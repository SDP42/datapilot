future phases are not anticipated in code.

### Phase 0 — Architecture / Foundation
- **Objective:** establish a clean, modular repository and a shared
  understanding of the architecture.
- **Components:** package skeleton, `datapilot` core (version, config),
  `LLMProvider` contract, docs (`architecture`, `modules`, `roadmap`,
  `architecture-principles`, `decisions`), packaging, tooling, smoke tests.
- **Output:** installable repo, passing foundation tests, this documentation.

### Phase 1 — Data Ingestion & Profiling
- **Objective:** load a dataset and describe it.
- **Components:** `data_engine.ingestion` (CSV/Parquet/Excel readers, schema
  inference, immutable raw registration), `data_engine.profiling`
  (column stats, dtype detection, cardinality, distribution summaries),
  shared `DatasetProfile` result contract.
- **Output:** a structured, serialisable dataset profile.
- **Status:** `ingest_dataset` (CSV only, immutable raw copy in
  `data/raw/`, `DatasetReference` handoff) and `profile_dataset` /
  `profile_dataframe` (→ `DatasetProfile`) implemented. The
  Ingestion ↔ Profiling contract is documented in
  [data-engine-contract.md](data-engine-contract.md). Parquet/Excel
  readers and richer distribution summaries come in later increments.

### Phase 2 — Data Quality & Cleaning
- **Objective:** find data problems and fix them under explicit control.
- **Components:** `data_engine.quality` detectors (missing, duplicates,
  invalid values, inconsistent categories, wrong dtypes, outliers,
  skewness, class imbalance, leakage signals); `data_engine.cleaning`
  operations driven by an approved `CleaningPlan`; `data_engine.preprocessing`.
- **Output:** a data-quality report and a cleaned dataset produced from a
  recorded plan.
- **Status:** `data_engine.quality` implemented — `analyze_quality`
  (`DatasetReference → QualityReport`) plus 7 modular, read-only checks
  (missing values, duplicate rows, potential type mismatch, inconsistent
  categories, IQR outliers, high skew, class imbalance when a target is
  supplied). Detection only; see [data-quality.md](data-quality.md).
  The cleaning engine (`data_engine.cleaning`) is not started.

### Phase 3 — Validation & Data Lineage
- **Objective:** guarantee transformations are safe and traceable.
- **Components:** `data_engine.validation` invariants; lineage store in
  `database` linking raw → each processed version with the operations
  applied.
- **Output:** validated processed datasets with a full transformation log.

### Phase 4 — EDA & Statistical Analysis
- **Objective:** understand relationships in the data.
- **Components:** univariate/bivariate analysis, correlation, statistical
  tests (SciPy/statsmodels), Matplotlib/Plotly figure generation.
- **Output:** structured EDA report with figures.

### Phase 5 — Automated Problem Understanding
- **Objective:** identify the ML task from data + objective.
- **Components:** task-type inference (classification/regression/…), target
  identification, candidate evaluation metrics, feasibility checks.
- **Output:** a `ProblemSpec`.

### Phase 6 — Feature Engineering
- **Objective:** build and select informative features deterministically.
- **Components:** transformers, encoders, interaction/aggregation features,
  selection methods; all recorded in lineage.
- **Output:** a feature matrix + feature definitions.

### Phase 7 — Classical ML
- **Objective:** train and evaluate classical models.
- **Components:** `ml_engine` model registry, training, prediction,
  cross-validation, evaluation with task-appropriate metrics
  (scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Output:** trained models + evaluation reports.

### Phase 8 — Deep Learning
- **Objective:** add DL where justified.
- **Components:** `dl_engine` PyTorch models, training loops, evaluation.
- **Output:** trained DL models + evaluation reports.

### Phase 9 — Experiment Tracking
- **Objective:** make every experiment reproducible and comparable.
- **Components:** `experimentation` definitions/execution/comparison,
  MLflow integration, seed and environment capture.
- **Output:** queryable experiment history and comparisons.

### Phase 10 — Explainable AI
- **Objective:** explain model behaviour.
- **Components:** `explainability` — feature importance, SHAP, partial
  dependence; structured explanation objects.
- **Output:** explanation reports per model.

### Phase 11 — AI Scientist / Agent
- **Objective:** LLM reasoning over structured results.
- **Components:** `ai_engine` concrete providers, prompt/context builders,
  interpretation of profiles/reports, experiment recommendations, tool
  schema definitions.
- **Output:** natural-language analysis + ranked recommended next steps.

### Phase 12 — Autonomous Experimentation
- **Objective:** planner → executor → critic loop under budgets.
- **Components:** planner, deterministic executor over the tool layer,
  evaluator/critic, budget and stop-condition management, human-reviewable
  trace.
- **Output:** an autonomously produced, fully traced analysis + model set.

### Phase 13 — Backend API
- **Objective:** expose the platform over HTTP.
- **Components:** `backend` FastAPI app, request/response schemas, job
  orchestration, PostgreSQL persistence, DuckDB for analytical queries.
- **Output:** a documented REST API.

### Phase 14 — Frontend
- **Objective:** interactive UI.
- **Components:** `frontend` Next.js + TypeScript app — dataset upload,
  profile/quality/EDA views, experiment dashboards, recommendation review.
- **Output:** a usable web application.

### Phase 15 — MLOps / Monitoring
- **Objective:** operate models in production.
- **Components:** model/data versioning, drift and performance monitoring,
  retraining triggers, alerting.
- **Output:** monitored, versioned production pipelines.

### Phase 16 — Deployment
- **Objective:** ship it.
- **Components:** Docker / Docker Compose, environment configs, CI/CD,
  release process.
- **Output:** reproducible deployable stack.

### Phase 17 — Testing, Benchmarking & Documentation
- **Objective:** continuous quality.
- **Components:** unit/integration/e2e tests, benchmark datasets and
  metrics, user and developer documentation.
- **Output:** test coverage, benchmark results, complete docs.
